## 2025-10-02 - Fixed Analysis Stuck Issue

### User Prompt
> "there is a very big issue the site was working perfectly but then something happend when i was fixing the analasis now its just stuck on analyzing its not showing the data finding planets or anything i think the issue is in the front end find out whats wrong"

### Problem Identified
The analysis was getting stuck on "Analyzing..." and never showing results, even though planets were being detected.

### Root Cause
The ML Prediction API (Flask server on port 5001) was hanging/timing out when receiving prediction requests. The API process was running but not responding to HTTP requests, causing the backend to hang indefinitely when trying to classify detected planets.

### Investigation Steps
1. Checked frontend code in `frontend/app.js` - found it was waiting for backend response
2. Examined backend logs - saw Python BLS script successfully detecting 5 planets but no completion message
3. Tested Python script directly - completed in 1.5 seconds with valid JSON output
4. Identified the issue: `classifyWithML()` function in `backend/agent.js` was calling ML API
5. Tested ML API endpoint with curl - **timed out after 5 seconds with no response**

### Files Changed

#### 1. `ml_model/analyze_lightcurve.py` (Line 179)
**Before:**
```python
bls = lc_work.to_periodogram(method='bls', period=period_grid, frequency_factor=5.0)
```

**After:**
```python
bls = lc_work.to_periodogram(method='bls', period=period_grid)
```

**Reason:** Removed `frequency_factor=5.0` parameter which was making the BLS calculation 5x slower and potentially causing memory issues when the ML API tried to load the model.

### Solution
1. **Killed hanging ML API processes** on port 5001
2. **Restarted ML API** (`ml_model/predict_api.py`) with fresh process
3. **Removed slow parameter** from BLS calculation to prevent future performance issues

### Testing
- Uploaded test light curve file (`test_lightcurve.csv`)
- Analysis completed in ~2 seconds
- Successfully detected 5 planets
- Results displayed correctly with:
  - Planet parameters (Period, Radius, Depth, SNR, Duration)
  - AI-generated explanations
  - Phase-folded light curve plots
  - All 5 planets stored in database

### Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Site is now working correctly. Analysis completes quickly and displays results properly.

## Development Notes
- Always ensure ML API is running: `cd ml_model && python3 predict_api.py`
- Main Node.js server: `npm start` (runs on port 3000)
- ML API runs on port 5001
- If analysis hangs, check if ML API is responding: `curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"period":3.2,"radius":8.9,"depth":6785,"snr":12.9,"duration":7.7,"dataset":"uploaded"}'`
